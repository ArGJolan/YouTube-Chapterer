# YouTube Chapterer

## Requirements

You need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on this machine as well as [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org)

## Usage

Put all your videos & `.info.json` files in a video folder (or its subfolders) at the root directory of this repo. (I used [TubeSync](https://github.com/meeb/tubesync))

Run `node index.js` and let the magic happen.
